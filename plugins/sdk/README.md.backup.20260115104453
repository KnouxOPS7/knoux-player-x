# KNOUX Player X™ - Developer SDK

Welcome to the official development kit for KNOUX Player X™. This SDK provides the necessary tools, types, and documentation to extend the functionality of the player through plugins.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js v18+
- TypeScript v5+

### Installation

Plugins are located in the `plugins/` directory of your user data folder. To start a new plugin project, you can use our scaffolding script or manually configure `package.json`.

```bash
# Example CLI usage (Coming Soon)
npm run knoux:create-plugin my-awesome-plugin
📚 API Reference
Plugins operate within a sandboxed Context provided by the host.
KnouxPlugin (Base Class)
All plugins must extend the KnouxPlugin abstract class exported from ../plugin-sdk.
code
TypeScript
import { KnouxPlugin, IPluginContext } from "@knoux/plugin-sdk";

export default class MyPlugin extends KnouxPlugin {
    onLoad() {
        this.context.toast("Plugin Loaded!");
        this.context.logger.info("MyPlugin initialized.");
    }

    onUnload() {
        // Cleanup resources
    }
}
Permissions
Define permissions in your manifest.json. Available scopes:
filesystem:read - Allow reading files.
dsp:audio - Access raw audio buffer manipulation.
ui:overlay - Inject components into the UI.
🛠 Project Structure
A valid plugin consists of:
manifest.json: Metadata and permissions.
dist/index.js: Compiled source entry.
